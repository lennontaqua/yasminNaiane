Now this is a story, all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside-down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said: You're movin with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air!

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packaged my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss
And then she gave me my ticket
I put my walkman on and said: I might as well kick it!

First class
Yo, this is bad
Drinkin orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people in Bel-Air livin like?
Hmm, this might be alright

But wait, I hear they're prissy
Bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared
For the prince of Bel-Air

Well, uh
The plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude, looked like a cop
Standin there with my name out
I ain't tryin to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness
Like lightening, dissappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said: Fresh
And had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought: Nah, forget it, yo home, to Bel-Air

I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie 'yo home, smell ya later
Looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
